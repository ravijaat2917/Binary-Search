Number of Unsuccessful Attempts
Description
Write a code that returns the number of unsuccessful attempts made to search for an element in the array using Binary search.
The code should
Take the size of the array as an input from the user
The elements of the array as an input from the user
The key you are searching for as an input from the user
Sample Input:
5
2 3 4 5 8
8

Sample Output:
2
So in this sample test case, the first input is the size of the array i.e the array has 5 elements. Next 5 inputs are the elements inside the array. The last input i.e. 8 is the key the code should search for. Since in this case, it will take 2 unsuccessful steps for the code to reach 8, so the output is 2.
